            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this is a notable propertie of our corrupt nature, we are forward and froward in exacting vpright dealing at other mens hands, ſlacke and backeward in returning the ſame back againe to others; In other mens dealings towards vs wee are Maſters, able to teach them what they ought to doe, but in our owne dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others we are ſcarce Schollers to learne our owne dutie. And from hence is it, that many times we are ſo much out of Quiet our ſelues, and ſo vainely ſow the ſeede of vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe among others. Therefore

                  <hi>they are no more two but one.</hi> Man and Wife are partners, like two oares in one boate, therefore they muſt both ſhare togither, and help togither; when the Husband is laborious, the Wife muſt not be riotous, when the Wife is thriftie, the Husband muſt not be prodigall, for the Husband that hath ſuch a Wife, caſteth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours into a bottomleſſe ſacke, and the Wife that is ſped with ſuch an Husband, draweth a cart heauie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den through a mirie way without an horſe. 4.

                  <hi>much diſcourage them.</hi> Fiftly, They muſt be exceeding warie in manifeſting their affection, for it is a dangerous thing for Parents to ſhew more loue and affection to one childe then to an other (except vpon great and iuſt occaſion) as we ſee by the example of

                  <hi>Iacobs</hi> children, who becauſe their father ſeemed to loue <hi>Ioſeph</hi> their brother more then them, they tooke occaſion to hate him and to worke much vnquietneſſe vnto him. Parents therefore, to preuent the like inconueniences, are to vſe equallitie among their children ſo neere as may be, whether in their ordinary vſage, or in the diuiſion of their goods. For, as all men naturally are enclined too much to the loue of earthly goods, ſo the vnequall ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame doth often times breed great brawles and pernitious debate betweene brethren. Sixtly,
<pb facs="tcp:2661:72"/>they muſt require no more of their children then they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, for that is a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto the childe when hee ſeeth his parent to be too hard vpon him, either in impoſing ouer much labor, or exacting more meanes of him then he is able to performe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, They muſt labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peace, vnity and concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their children: a notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident wherein Parents may learne from <hi>Scilurus</hi> an ethnick parent,

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2661:72"/>will deſtroy, and ouerthrow you. This dutie of Parents to keepe their children in peace and louing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Lacon Apoth.</note> did the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, for when on a time two brethren fell at ſtrife and contention, they puniſhed both the father and the mother, becauſe by good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they had not preuented, or at leaſt wiſe, preſently appeaſed the diſſention betweene their children.

<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2.</note> but in matters of waight and of importance. The Law is not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a iudge of euery trifle, not for the ſmaller and triuiall matters.

It is a ſhame for our Nation that at euery Aſſiſes there ſhould bee ſo many actions of treſpaſſe, wherein the dammage is little or nothing. 2. It muſt be the laſt refuge: Law is a kinde of warre, as therefore warre is the laſt meanes for the attaining of publike peace, ſo ſhould the Law bee the laſt meanes for the attaining of priuate peace: All meanes muſt bee tried, ere thou goe to law,

It is a fowle miſorder in our land, men are ſued when they would gladly compound, when they would willingly ſatisfie by priuate order, they are compelled to anſwer by Law; yea which is worſe then this; the Law which ſhould bee the laſt, is not onely made the firſt meanes, but many times a cloſe and a ſecret meanes, it ſtealeth vpon men before they bee aware, and heapeth charge where it might bee auoided. 3.

And therefore the <hi>Preacher</hi> muſt be a principall Actor for the preſeruation of Quietneſſe. It was once a common ſaying, that the want of preaching, was the cauſe of the want of Quietneſſe; I haue heard a queſtion once moued, what was the cauſe that there were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad Lawyers, which was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, becauſe there were ſo few good Preachers. But now, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, there are many good Preachers (the Lord increaſe their number) Sermons are plentifull, and many publicke lectures. And yet alaſſe we ſee little the more quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nay our ignorant common people would perſwade themſelues that there is the leſſe Quietneſſe. Notwithſtanding all which I would admoniſh and deſire, yea in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus beſeech my reuerent brethren and fellow labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in Gods harueſt, that they would both in their lectures conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
